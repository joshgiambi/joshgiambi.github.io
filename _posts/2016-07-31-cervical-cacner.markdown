# Background

## Epidemiology

------

### Incidence and Mortality

Incidence and mortality rates of invasive cancer have declined due to screening programs to detect pre-invasive disease. The average presentation is 40 yrs old. 99% are related to HPV transmission and exposure. Based on 2010 estimates, about 1 in 152 Canadian women is expected to develop cervical cancer during her lifetime and 1 in 475 will die from it.

###### In Canada, it is estimated that in 2015

- 1,500 Canadian women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer.
- 380 women will die from cervical cancer in Canada.
- Chances (probability) of developing or dying from cervical cancer

###### Adenocarcinoma Rising Incidence

- Adenocarcinoma is rising in incidence, especially in women younger than 35 years of age. 
- Part of the increase may be attributable to an increasing prevalence of HPV infection and part to improvements in screening and prevention of squamous intraepithelial neoplasia; thus leading to a histologic shift towards adenocarcinoma

### Statistics

- 3rd most common gynecologic cancer 


- 6th most common cancer in women
- 40 years average age at presentation 


- 99% associated with HPV 
- Screening -> reduced mortality by 70%

### Risk Factors

###### Gynecologic

1. Early onset sexual activity
2. Large number of sexual partners 
3. STD's and high risk partners 

###### Behavioural

1. Smoking 
2. Prolonged OCP use 

###### HPV Related

- See Below

## Human Papilloma Virus

HPV Comprises 85% of cervical cancers. The most common subtypes include 16 and 18 which contribute to 70% of cervical cancers.

HPV 16 and 18 have a high malignant potential, HPV 29, 31, 33 have low malignant potential and genital warts are generally caused by HPV 6 and 11. 

##### Subtypes

- HPV 16 / 18 — high malignant potential
- HPV 29, 31, 33 — low malignant potential
- HPV 6, 11 — genital warts

### Mechanism of Action

###### <u>E6 downregulates P63</u>

- **p53** functions as a negative regulator of cell growth, controling transit from G0/G1 to S Phase. It is a tumor supressor protein. 
- E6 binds to p53 promoting degredation causing an antiapoptotic effect, permitting the accumulation of chromosomal mutations without DNA repair

###### <u>E7 binds to Retinoblastoma</u>

- **Retinoblastoma** is a protien that inhibits the effect of positive growth regulation in response to DNA damage, it halts cell growth or induces cell apoptosis bind and render inactive the E2F transcription factor (E2F controls DNA synthesis and cyclin function and promotes the S phase of cell cycling)
- E7 binds to Rb Via an E2F/Rb protein complex. E2F is released and allows cyclin A to promote cell cycling → permit cells with damaged DNA to bypass the G1 growth arrest. 



# Diagnosis

## Pathology

------

### Subtypes

##### **Sqamous Cell Carcinoma** — 20% of HPV cancers

##### **Adenocarcinoma** — 80% of HPV Cancers

##### **Rare** — Clear Cell Carcinoma

### In Situ Disease

##### ASCUS

- Atypical squamous cells of unknown significant 
- 2/3 resolve spontaneously 
- Repeat PAP in 6 months and colposcopy if abnormal 

##### LGSIL

- Low grade squamous lesion 
- Resolves spontaneously 40% of the time 
- Repeat PAP in 6 months and colposcopy if abnormal 

##### HGSIL

- Highest grade squamous lesion 
- All should undergo colposcopy with biopsy 
- 30% resolve spontaneously 
- 22% progress to invasive lesions



## Presentation

------

### Clinical Presentation

##### Early Symptoms

1. Abnormal vaginal bleeding
2. Post-coital bleeding
3. Abnormal vaginal discharge

###### Late Symptoms

- Triad of sciatic pain, lower extremity edema, hydronephrosis 
- Pelvic pain
- Urinary or rectal symptoms 
- Fistulations 

### Investigation

| Workup             | Imaging      | FIGO Imaging |
| :----------------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Pelvic examination | CT Scanning  | Chest X-ray  |
| US and biopsy      | MRI Scanning | Barium Enema |
| Cystoscopy         | PET CT       | IV pyelogram |

### Route of Spread

##### Local Extension

- Direct extension into parametria, ureterosacral ligament, vesicovaginal space, perirectal space, vagina 
- Ovarian spread is rare 

##### Regional Nodes

- Stepwise progression alog lymph node echelons from pelvic to para-aortic nodes to thoracic duct to left supraclavicular nodes 
- Proximal metastasis in the absence of pelvic node involvement is uncommon 

##### Distant Metastasis

- Distant mets are uncommon in the absence of extensive local or lymph node invovlement 
- Most common sites are: **lung, liver and bone**

| Nodal Spread | Pelvic Nodes | PA Nodes |
| :----------- | :----------- | :------: |
| **Stage 1**  | 15%          |    5%    |
| **Stage 2**  | 30%          |   20%    |
| **Stage 3**  | 50%          |   30%    |

## Factors

###### 1. Tumor Stage

###### 2. Depth of invasion

###### 3. FIGO Stage



## Depth of Invasion

The degree of depth of invasion influences the positive lymph node rate substantially.
